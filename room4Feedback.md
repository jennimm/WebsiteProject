Feedback on Website
====================

Interest of content - Excellent - The content was interesting and informative

Consistency and quality of visual presentation - Very good - There could've been slightly more consistency with the text sizes and page layout, however there was a good use of images. Sometimes there were labels where you wouldn't expect them like on the homepage.

Quality of written presentation - Excellent - Neatly presented content.

Validity of HTML - Good - There are some unexpected tags at the top of pages and there are quite a few warnings when checked by an HTML validator.

Evidence of collaboration including:
------------------

Author info not written by author - Excellent

Balanced contributions from members - Good - The commits could've been more equally distributed, seems like the work wasn't evenly distributed

Not completed at the last minute - Excellent - Commits made over several days, not left until the last minute
